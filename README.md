# Seq2seq_Dialogue_Model

In this project we want to create end-to-end dialogue systems, following on from the seq2seq MT labs you've done. Customer support apps and online helpdesks are among the places where conversational modelsÂ can be used. Retrieval-based models, which produce predefined responses to questions of specific types, are often used to power these models. In this seq2seq model is used to build a generative model.
